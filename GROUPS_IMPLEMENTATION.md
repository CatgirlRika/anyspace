# Groups System Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
"Groups: Create and join interest-based groups for discussions and events."

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ Complete Groups System
The groups feature has been fully implemented from a "Coming Soon!" placeholder to a complete functional system:

#### Core Features:
1. **Group Creation** - Users can create interest-based groups with names and descriptions
2. **Group Discovery** - Browse all available groups with member counts and descriptions  
3. **Group Membership** - Join multiple groups (improved from single-group limitation)
4. **Group Events** - Create and view events within groups with date/time scheduling
5. **Group Discussions** - Comment and discuss within group pages
6. **Member Management** - View all group members with profile pictures

#### Technical Implementation:

**Database Schema Updates:**
- Added `group_events` table for event management
- Added `group_memberships` table for proper many-to-many relationships
- Extended existing `groups` and `groupcomments` tables

**Files Modified/Fixed:**
- `public/groups/groups.php` - Main groups listing (was "Coming Soon!")
- `public/groups/viewgroup.php` - Group details with events and members
- `public/groups/newgroup.php` - Group creation functionality
- `public/groups/joingroup.php` - Improved group joining with membership tracking
- `public/groups/index.php` - Now redirects to main groups page
- `core/site/user.php` - Added helper functions getID() and getPFP()

**Key Improvements:**
- Fixed PDO query syntax throughout (was mixing mysqli and PDO)
- Added proper error handling and user feedback
- Implemented multiple group memberships (was limited to one)
- Added events functionality as specified in requirements
- Created comprehensive test suite

#### User Experience:
- Clean, consistent UI following existing site patterns
- Responsive design for mobile compatibility
- Intuitive navigation between group features
- Visual feedback for join/membership status
- Profile picture integration for member display

### ✅ Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite (`tests/groups_system.php`)
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Verified syntax and functionality of all group files

The groups system now fully meets the requirement for "interest-based groups for discussions and events" and provides a solid foundation for community building within the platform.
