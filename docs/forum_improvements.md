# Forum Module Improvements

This document describes the improvements made to the forum module as requested in the requirements.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Quick Reply Functionality

**Location:** `public/forum/post.php`
**CSS:** `public/static/css/forum.css`

The existing reply form has been enhanced with:
- Better visual presentation with a dedicated "Quick Reply" section
- Improved styling with gradients matching the forum theme
- Larger textarea with placeholder text for better UX
- Clear button to reset the form
- Dark mode support

**Benefits:**
- Users can post replies directly from the topic view without navigation
- Consistent with existing forum UI patterns
- Maintains all existing functionality (quote, moderation, etc.)

### 2. Topic Preview on Hover

**Location:** `public/forum/topic.php`, `core/forum/topic.php`
**CSS:** `public/static/css/forum.css`

New functionality that shows topic previews when hovering over topic titles:
- AJAX endpoint at `topic.php?preview=1&topic_id=X` returns JSON preview data
- JavaScript handles hover events with 500ms delay to prevent accidental triggers
- Preview popup shows author and first 150 characters of the first post
- Responsive positioning and styling consistent with forum theme
- Dark mode support

**Benefits:**
- Users can quickly preview topic content without clicking
- Reduces unnecessary page loads
- Improves forum navigation experience

### 3. Forum Statistics Caching

**Location:** `core/forum/forum.php`, `core/forum/post.php`, `core/forum/topic.php`
**Cache Directory:** `cache/`

Implemented file-based caching system for forum statistics:
- 5-minute TTL (Time To Live) for cached statistics
- Automatic cache invalidation when posts or topics are created
- Support for both forum-specific and global statistics
- Efficient cache management with automatic cleanup

**Functions Added:**
- `forum_get_cached_stats($forum_id)` - Get cached or fresh statistics
- `forum_compute_stats($forum_id)` - Compute fresh statistics
- `forum_clear_stats_cache($forum_id)` - Clear specific or all caches

**Benefits:**
- Significant performance improvement for forums with many posts
- Reduces database load on high-traffic forums
- Scalable caching solution

## Technical Details

### Database Changes
No database schema changes were required. All functionality uses existing tables.

### Cache Structure
```
cache/
├── forum_stats_0.json      # Global statistics
├── forum_stats_1.json      # Forum ID 1 statistics
└── forum_stats_N.json      # Forum ID N statistics
```

### CSS Classes Added
- `.quick-reply-section` - Container for quick reply form
- `.quick-reply-form` - Form styling
- `.reply-controls` - Form controls layout
- `.reply-buttons` - Button container
- `.reply-submit` - Submit button styling
- `.reply-clear` - Clear button styling
- `.topic-preview-popup` - Preview popup container
- `.preview-header` - Preview header styling
- `.preview-body` - Preview content styling
- `.topic-link` - Enhanced topic link styling

### JavaScript Functions
- Topic preview system with hover detection
- AJAX preview data fetching
- Automatic popup positioning
- Event cleanup on mouse leave

## Testing

### Automated Tests
- `tests/forum_improvements.php` - Tests all new functionality
- Existing tests continue to pass: `forum_posts.php`, `forum_public.php`

### Manual Testing
- `manual_test.html` - Interactive test page for UI verification
- All features tested with screenshots captured

## Compatibility

### Existing Features
All existing forum functionality remains intact:
- Post creation and editing
- Moderation tools (lock, sticky, delete, etc.)
- User permissions and roles
- Notifications and subscriptions
- Reactions and polls
- Word filtering and content validation

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- Graceful degradation for hover preview (works without JavaScript)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox used for responsive layouts

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts
- Statistics caching reduces database queries significantly
- Preview system reduces unnecessary page loads
- File-based caching is lightweight and fast

### Considerations
- Preview AJAX calls add minimal network overhead
- Cache files are small (typically <1KB) and auto-managed
- CSS and JavaScript additions are minimal and optimized

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Redis or Memcached support for distributed caching
- Preview caching to reduce AJAX calls
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick reply
- Rich text editor integration
- Real-time statistics updates via WebSocket

## Configuration

### Cache Settings
Default cache TTL is 5 minutes, configurable in `forum_get_cached_stats()`:
```php
$cache_ttl = 300; // 5 minutes in seconds
```

### Preview Settings
Preview length is configurable in `forum_get_topic_preview()`:
```php
if (strlen($preview) > 150) {
    $preview = substr($preview, 0, 150) . '...';
}
```

### JavaScript Timing
Hover delay is configurable in the JavaScript:
```javascript
previewTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    // Show preview
}, 500); // 500ms delay
```
